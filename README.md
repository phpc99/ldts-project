# LDTS T15G03 - Memory Card Game

The Memory Card Game we’re implementing is a classic matching game where players test their memory by revealing pairs of cards from a face-down grid. The goal is to match all pairs in as few turns as possible. Each time two selected cards don’t match, they flip back down, challenging players to remember their positions for future attempts. The game rewards concentration, making it both engaging and competitive.
